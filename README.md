# Extracting sunbeams from cucumbers: Computational reproducibility is essential for archaeological science

This repository contains the data and code for my paper to be submitted
to the Journal of Archaeological Science. Earlier versions were
presented at the University of Cambridge
[(2019)](https://github.com/benmarwick/March-2019-Cambridge-Big-Data-Archaeology)
and New York University
[(2025)](https://github.com/benmarwick/nyu-2025-workshop)

## Contents

The **analysis** directory contains:

- [:file_folder: paper](/analysis/paper): Quarto source document for
  manuscript. Includes code to reproduce the figures and tables
  generated by the analysis.
- [:file_folder: data](/analysis/data): Data used in the analysis.
- [:file_folder: figures](/analysis/figures): Plots and other
  illustrations

## How to run in your browser or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical
programming language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R
software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself and optionally [RStudio
Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL:
[master.zip](/archive/master.zip). After unzipping:

- open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio  
- install the packages used in the Quarto document  
- finally, render the `analysis/paper/paper.qmd` document to produce the
  `paper.docx`, or run `rmarkdown::render("analysis/paper/paper.qmd")`
  in the R console
